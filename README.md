CrossGLESMobile
===============

This is a project to demonstrate cross platform native applications using OpenGL ES 2.0. This will show how to create projects that can work on any mobile environment that supports C (Includes IOS and Android).


Curently I am not sure how to make a common project structure. Anyone want to help with that? Feel free to fork...

More to come!!!!
